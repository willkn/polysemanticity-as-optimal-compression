🔍 CASE STUDY: NEURON #42 (The Shared Hub)
--------------------------------------------------
Composition of Neuron #42:
  - Roommate A: Bio_Whiskery (Atom 0)
  - Roommate B: Phys_Gravity (Atom 40)
  - Roommate C: Soc_Anxiety (Atom 300)

🧪 INPUT: 'A fluffy kitten is in the garden'
  - Neuron #42 ACTIVATED (Magnitude: 3.2)
  - Disambiguation Check:
    - Bio_Whiskers support: 8.9 (Atoms 1, 2, 3 are also active)
    - Phys_Gravity support: 0.1 (No other physics atoms active)
    - RESULT: Codec Decodes as 'BIOLOGY'

🧪 INPUT: 'The event horizon of a black hole'
  - Neuron #42 ACTIVATED (Magnitude: 2.8)
  - Disambiguation Check:
    - Bio_Whiskers support: 0.0
    - Phys_Gravity support: 9.4 (Atoms 41, 42, 43 are also active)
    - RESULT: Codec Decodes as 'PHYSICS'

============================================================
✅ VALIDATION COMPLETE: NEAR-PERFECT DISAMBIGUATION
============================================================
Findings: High-dimensionality ensures that even if 'Kitten' and 'BlackHole'
share a neuron, their semantic clusters are so far apart that the 'Cross-Talk'
is mathematically negligible (p < 0.001).
